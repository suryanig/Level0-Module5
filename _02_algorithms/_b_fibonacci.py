    #  here is more than one way to code a solution to this.
    #  The following steps give you some guidelines for one of them.
    #  1. Declare and initialize three int variables: number1, number2,
    #     and sum.
    #  2. Initialize number1 and number2 to the first two numbers of the
    #     fibonacci sequence (0 and 1) and print both numbers.
    #  3. Use a for loop that calculates the sum of the two numbers and
    #     prints it. The for loop should repeat 10 times.
    #  4. Now try to figure out how to change the variables before the for
    #     loop repeats so the sequence of numbers is correct.
